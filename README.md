# GABlind (Client)

Project developed during my studies with a team of 11-members, of which I was the code architect.<br>
This has been created as part of an "intensive-project week" with theme : Handicaped people & Banks (or something along those lines... Can't quite remember after so many years ^^)<br>
We received the "Jury prize" for that project for its ingenuity (in particular regarding the controls using the number of fingers on the screen, simplifying the usage of tactile screens for visually impaired people)

Our idea was simply to propose a proof-of-concept (using an Android tablet as the "ATM's screen") which would provide functionnalities to help visually impaired people when using an ATM.

It felt quite amazing back then...<br>
But having a look at the code after all those years, I can't help but noticing all the things we could have done differently... Starting with proper commit messages ðŸ˜œ

## Why "GABlind" ?
This is quite simply the concatenation of the words "GAB" (which stands for "ATM" in French) and "Blind".

## What about the server ?
I personally hadn't worked on that part, but the code can be found in the original repository : https://github.com/handigab
